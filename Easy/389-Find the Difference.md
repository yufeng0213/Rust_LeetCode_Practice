You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 


My Code:
```
impl Solution {
  pub fn find_the_difference(s: String, t: String) -> char {
      let mut src = vec![0;26];
      let ch:char = '0';
      
      for c in s.chars(){
        src[c as usize - 'a' as usize] -= 1;
      }

      for c in t.chars(){
        src[c as usize - 'a' as usize] += 1;
        if src[c as usize - 'a' as usize] == 1{
          return c;
        }
      }

      ch

  }
}

```
